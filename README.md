# Wallet API

## Installation + usage

```
$ cp packages/user/.env.example packages/user/.env
$ cp packages/wallet/.env.example packages/wallet/.env

$ docker-compose up
```

It sets up the entire workspace.
Then you have the user and wallet services up on 3002 and 3001 ports respectively.

I have also uploaded my postman collection just in case.

Have fun!
